This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The root route immediately redirects based on your session stateâ€”authenticated users land on the dashboard while guests are sent to the login screen. To experiment with the UI, edit a page that actually renders content such as `src/app/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx` or `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`. The app auto-updates as you edit those files.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
